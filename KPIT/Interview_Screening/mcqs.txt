12)
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int x = printf("Hello");
    printf(" %d", x);
}

The printf function returns the number of characters printed to the standard output, which here is 5.

13)
struct {
    type member_name : width;
} variable_name;

struct {
    int x : 8;
} data;

In this example, data.x is a bit-field of type int with 8 bits. 
(The question is wrong on the site, this is the corrected version)

15)
Do-while loop is an exit controlled loop.
(others are entry controlled i.e check condition on entry)

22)
printf("%d %d", (023), (23));

23 is printed as it is. 023 is interpreted as an octal number which is equivalent to decimal 19.

#
0b1010 is binary
0xA is hex
023 is octal

023 = 2 * 8^1 + 3 * 8^0 = 19
